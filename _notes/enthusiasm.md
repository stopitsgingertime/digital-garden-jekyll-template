The amateur “mode” is one that is accessible and achievable through a set of personal affective states: wonder, “flow,” [[homo ludens|play]], [[obsession]], but most importantly (in my view) enthusiasm. 

Enthusiasm, as an often denigrated and frequently [[gender|gendered]] emotion, serves as the driving force behind amateur activities. As Hilary Geoghegan notes, deploying Sarah Ahmed’s theorization of affect, enthusiasm “reveals its potential to produce surfaces and boundaries upon which groups can form and shared interests can ‘stick’” (2012) and produces conditions of kindness, bonding, social cohesion, and attraction. 

In actively seeking the benefits of amateurism, some people may require teaching or in fact re-teaching on how to be an amateur, in the form of an orienting-towards, a systematic but playful discovery of the elements of the mindset and body-set of passionate enthusiasm.
