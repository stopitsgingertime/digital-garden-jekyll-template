The song “Crank Dat” by SouljaBoy reached the top of the charts in 2005, earning the artist millions of dollars and a major record deal. This was notable because the song had been produced in ten minutes on a cheap DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) called FruityLoops, or FL Studio—and heralded a new age in the democratization of music production (Jackson, 2015). 

Prior to the 2000s, music production was a rarefied field, dominated by professionals with ownership of the physical spaces (such as studios) and technologies (mixing boards, microphones) necessary to produce high-quality music. The high barrier for entry meant that musicians had to either sign deals with record labels who could front the money necessary for recording, or try and find the money to record through independent means. 

The development of ADAT technology in the 1990s heralded a new age in digital recording and “began the movement of professional-level multitrack recording out of the major studios and into the homes and garages of independent musicians and producers” (Phillips, 2010). 

But the real game-changer was the DAW. FL Studio, for example, was used widely in demo and/or illegally downloaded versions by producers to create hits in their home. The ability to create and record music almost for free transformed the hierarchy of the industry, and allowed the amateur musician or beatmaker to ascend to the top without needing to kowtow to engineers or labels for studio time. Instrumentalist and hitmaker Steve Lacy famously produced hits for Kanye West on his iPhone, on a mobile version of GarageBand, before upgrading to more traditional DAWs and studio equipment ([Pierce, 2017](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/steve-lacy-iphone-producer/)).
