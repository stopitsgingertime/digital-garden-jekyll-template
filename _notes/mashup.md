Mashup cultures, whether audio-based, visual, or literary, represent the possibilities inherent in technology’s relationship to art, especially from the perspective of the amateur. 

The most familiar use of the word “mashup” today might be its common usage to refer to combinations of songs, “mashed-up” with each other and overlaid into remixes that stand on their own. 

In the early 2000s, thanks to easy production made possible by free and accessible [[DAW|DAWs]] and distribution made possible by noncommercial file-sharing services such as Napster and Kazaa, the mashup genre was popularized and made emblematic of the new 21st century era of the democratization of culture through technology. As John Shiga identified, “A new amateur musicianship emerges from this process, based on the reorganization of the relations that constitute musical recordings” (2007). 

But prior to the era of the audio mashup, pop-cultural remixes and remediations were central to the Pop Art movement; and before that, avant-garde practitioners from the Dadaists to Soviet montage-makers took part in assemblages and transformations of culture of the sort that foreground contemporary digital mashups. Even the [[commonplace book]] makers of the 19th century participated in a kind of mash-up transformation, creating a shared amateur poetics through juxtaposition and modification of existing literature. 

Today, on user-generated content platforms like TikTok, songs and visuals are matched and mashed up with astounding accessibility and speed.
