From the Antarctic [[radio]] communications of the Madey brothers to the APA’s network of young [[journalism|journalists]], amateur cultures can allow young people to ‘try on’ the mantle of professionalism while remaining unbound by responsibility, financial or otherwise. The combination of youthfulness and technology is a potent one which has resulted in a great deal of subcultural innovation on the part of hobbyists, amateurs, and enthusiasts. Young people involved in young cultural or technological fields contribute to the phenomena and practices which come to define those fields professionally, as Thomas Streeter noted with regards to ham radio enthusiasts (1996). 

In their monograph *The Pro-Am Revolution,* authors Charles Leadbeater and Paul Miller acknowledge the importance of their demographic the “pro-am” (professional amateur) in all levels of society, but particularly as innovators and independent leaders of change and advancement: “Amateurs have a long track record of innovation, especially in emerging fields which are too young for there to be an organised and professional body of knowledge or too marginal to warrant the attention of companies or universities” (2004).
