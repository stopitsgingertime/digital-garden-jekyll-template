“Amateur” may be familiar to some people as simply the name of a pornographic category. The rise, fall, and appeal of this category is beyond the scope of this project, but simply put the definition is pornography created by those who are not “professional” pornographic actors, who are not paid for their work and ostensibly are not part of the pornographic industry. 

This category has taken on more importance alongside the rise of the democratization of digital content production; the ability to film, edit, and distribute pornography for little to no cost. The deluge of legitimate amateur pornography contrasts with the professional genre of amateur pornography, or “reality pornography,” which is produced professionally and for profit, but aesthetically made to look or feel like it was made by amateurs. 

Amateur erotic content is an important genre for the expression and representation of [[queering|queer]] and otherwise non-normative bodies and identities; it can and often does exist (like [[zine|zines]] and [[mashup|mashups]]) in opposition and resistance to the mainstream. 

At the same time, the abundance of free digital amateur pornography impacts the ability of performers and sex workers to [[Neoliberal economy|earn money]] from their labor (Ruberg 2016); and amateur porn has just as much ability to reify heteronormativity and misogyny as professionally-produced material (van Doorn, 2010).
