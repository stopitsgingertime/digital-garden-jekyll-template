The “gentleman [[amateur]],” with enough time and money to devote to [[leisure]] and pursuits of passion, dominated certain fields during the 19th century. Before history, for example, was developed into an established professional and academic pursuit, it was the province of societies of antiquaries and local enthusiasts who contributed to a cloistered culture of researching, documenting, and collecting. Women were marked rarities in these communities in Britain (although they did contribute [[Gender|vital work]]), and the vast majority of the men were middle or upper-class, Anglican, and educated at Cambridge or Oxford. These men were “passionately committed to their work even when burdened with other professional duties” (Levine 1985) and maintained networks of communication and collaboration throughout the country. 

As the Victorian era wore on, divisions between members of the growing professional scientific classes and those who still pursued a more traditional amateur approach. This was not by any means a linear progression. For example, Ruth Barton notes that “in the late nineteenth and into the twentieth century, geographical exploration and ornithology replaced geology as appropriate activities for wealthy gentlemen” (2003). 

But even exploration was a contested space: “[Royal Geographical Society] leaders viewed their society’s activities as scientific even though some in the Royal Society might dismiss them as craft or even hobby” (Larson 2011). Rivalries between and within different schools of science increasingly deployed “amateur” and associated vocabulary in a denigratory manner.
