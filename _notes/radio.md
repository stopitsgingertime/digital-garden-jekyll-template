After the 1920s, with the rise of broadcasting and radio as a mass medium, amateur radio became a separate and independent community. As two-way communication lost its status as the “default” method of engagement with the technology, hams were defined as a separate hobbyist society, and developed a distinct identity. The practice at-midcentury was highly [[gender|gendered]], associated mainly with white, married middle-class men (Haring 2003). Unlike popular radio, ham as a hobby was personal: operators would exchange news of their families and their lives, enacting a networked community over the airwaves.

The culture of hams was tight-knit and geeky. A shared culture amongst operators, their separation from passive mass broadcasting, and their personal identification with their hobby, meant that a platform dynamic could arise. Hobbyists kept careful track of which stations they contacted and who they spoke to over the airwaves. A major accomplishment during the interwar era was the first trans-Atlantic radio contact between amateur radio operators: one in America and one in France. Interestingly, the two amateurs in question had met in person earlier that year at a convention for ham radio [[enthusiasm|enthusiasts]].

Driven by the affinity and enthusiasm that characterizes amateur cultures, ham radio was an early and notable example of how obsession could intersect with technology on a person-to-person level in order to create a participatory network.
