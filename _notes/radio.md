After the 1920s, with the rise of broadcasting and radio as a mass medium, amateur radio became a separate and independent community. As two-way communication lost its status as the “default” method of engagement with the technology, hams were defined as a separate hobbyist society, and developed a distinct identity. The practice at-midcentury was highly [[gender|gendered]], associated mainly with white, married middle-class men (Haring 2003). Unlike popular radio, ham as a hobby was personal: operators would exchange news of their families and their lives, enacting a networked community over the airwaves.

The culture of hams was tight-knit and geeky. A shared culture amongst operators, their separation from passive mass broadcasting, and their personal identification with their hobby, meant that a platform dynamic could arise. Hobbyists kept careful track of which stations they contacted and who they spoke to over the airwaves. A major accomplishment during the interwar era was the first trans-Atlantic radio contact between amateur radio operators: one in America and one in France. Interestingly, the two amateurs in question had met in person earlier that year at a convention for ham radio [[enthusiasm|enthusiasts]].

In the 1950s, the Madey brothers of New Jersey were teenage hams who ended up being responsible for communications between military installations in Antarctica and the rest of the US. Their indulgent parents had permitted them to build a hundred-foot tall radio antenna in their backyard, which meant that they could receive transmissions from around the world, including from the base under construction at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica—and patch them through to the US phone system, allowing the Navy men to speak to their loved ones from the bottom of the world (Hood, 2009)

Driven by the affinity and enthusiasm that characterizes amateur cultures, ham radio was an early and notable example of how obsession could intersect with technology on a person-to-person level in order to create a participatory network with large impacts.
