Cultural historian Johan Huizinga’s definition of human beings as “Homo ludens” (the Playing Man) in his landmark 1955 work of the same name is founded in the idea of “play” being essential to our behavior and society.  

He gave the definition of play as: “Play is a free activity standing quite consciously outside ‘ordinary’ life as being ‘not serious,’ but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner.”

Human activities, from lawsuits to war, are framed by Huizinga as emerging from our instinct to play. Concerned with the increasing complexity of society, he decries seriousness and professionalization as a threat to humanity’s essence: “It now appears that the ever-increasing systematization and discipline of play are going to suppress in the long run something of the pure play-element.” 

The captivating flow which defines devotion to amateur activities has resonance with Huizinga’s conception of play.
