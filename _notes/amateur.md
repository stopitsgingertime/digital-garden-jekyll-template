<p>What is an amateur?</p>

<p>Amidst the rapid professionalization of digital creators via linked cultural concepts of productivity, monetization, and the “side hustle,” it’s more important than ever to examine the motivations and the history behind amateur practices, and how and why people decide to do things out of love of them.</p>

<p>As Saikat Majumdar and Aarthi Vadde put it in the introduction to their 2020 volume *The Critic as Amateur,* “What would it mean to claim the mantle of the amateur as a way of understanding knowledge better?”</p>

<p>A broad investigation of the amateur requires looking at history, sociology, psychology, literature and media, and technology.</p>

<p>From perspectives on ideas of [[leisure]] and play to chronicles of the ebbs and flows of various nonprofessional and hobbyist communities, this A to Z will provide a brief introduction to a variety of artifacts, concepts, events, and people which can offer insight into the world of the amateur.</p>
