The Novelty Job Printing Press, introduced in America 1869, was the technological advancement at the heart of the growth of the amateur journalism community, or “amateurdom” or just “the Dom” as it was often known. 

A community composed for the most part of [[youth|young]] people, often teenage boys, with the available leisure time and money to participate in a labor-intensive hobby, amateurdom was centered around the production—the composition, typsetting, and mailing—of short-form newspapers. The audience for these newspapers was not the wider reading public but instead other members of the community (Isaac 2012), and while they covered many topics, often they were “about” the community itself, in a self-fulfilling loop of literary production. 

Amateur newspapers included advertisements for local businesses, letters from readers and other editors, as well as editorials and articles. 

Like the community of [[commmonplace book]] creators, amateurdom was an “an affective state as well as a textual commons” (Gitelman 2014), a “public youth culture” which was powered by a strong community history as well as the rise of the “teenager” as an identity which fell in between traditional childhood and adulthood and required its own pastimes, and strong, social self-definitions. 

Some participants in late 19th-century and early 20th-century amateurdom went on to become successful professional authors and journalists; others, including H.P. Lovecraft, brought their experience to bear on the community dynamics of early Golden Age science fiction [[fandom.]]
