The invention and popularization of easy copying technologies made possible a great deal of amateur culture in the 20th century. Cheap home printing presses allowed the birth of [[journalism|amateurdom]]; and the mimeograph and then especially the Xerox allowed amateur print culture to flourish and take on more importance in the context of the larger subcultural underground than ever before. 

Xerox is the trademark of the Xerox Corporation, who introduced the first mass-market photocopier in the late 1950s, and the word quickly became genericized to refer to the type of fast, easy photographic copies that the machines afforded. The powerful but tetchy Xerox 910 glass-bed xerographic copier was at the time thought to be the most successful product in business history; attended to in offices and institutions by [[Gender|usually-female]] operators who anthropomorphized its quirks, coming to care deeply for the machines and exemplifying, in New Yorker writer John Brooks’ words, “the closest relationship between a woman and a piece of office equipment that I had ever seen” (1967). 

In the 1960s when the product was first flourishing, cultural anxieties about the decreasing importance of the book were present in the popular press. “Authorship and readership alike can become production-oriented under xerography,” Marshall McLuhan wrote in 1966, predicting a revolution in the world of publishing. His prediction was borne out by the explosion in [[zines|zine-making]] as practice and praxis; the abundance of amateur cultural content which worked to disrupt the mainstream in the subsequent decades.
