The amateur queer historians of the mid-20th century, associated with projects like ONE Magazine and the Mattachine Society, worked to educate and raise consciousness of their audience on the necessity of understanding the past of their shared identity. 

One of those historians, Jim Kepner, wrote in 1955: “Perhaps the history that will emerge, being largely the work of amateurs, will suffer some of the telltale effects of scholastic shortcomings, yet this will not be the first field to be staked out by autonomous students, and in time, when the foundations have been laid, the
professionals may be emboldened to apply the finishing touches” (quoted in Richlin, 2005). 

Necessarily underground by nature for most of the recent past, queer subcultures—just like the other subaltern communities like [[youth]] subcultures and women’s [[commonplace books|domestic practices]]—for that reason have a deep connection to the concept of the amateur. 

In the context of research and the academy, Carolyn Dinshaw in her study of enthusiastic medievalists and queer temporality identifies amateur researchers as “a bit queer in a professionalized, detached modernist world” and observes that “the act of taking one’s own sweet time asserts a queer force [..] Queer, amateur: these are mutually reinforcing terms” (2012). And in the larger context of culture, Ben Walters aligns amateurism with both anarchism and queerness, arguing that it “can be a potent mode for disrupting normative expectations” (2020).
