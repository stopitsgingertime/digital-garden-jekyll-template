The zine was a popular form of underground literature in the 20th century. First produced by the pop-cultural communities of science fiction fandom, in a direct lineage from the [[journalism|Amateur Press Associations]] that many early SFF fans came from, fanzines (as they were originally known, as a contraction of “fan magazine”) were cheaply [[Xerox|copied]] using mimeograph (or adjacent replicating technologies like hectograph) and distributed in-person at conventions or through mailing lists. 

These zines, as material representations of the subcultures they came from, spawned their own idiolectic vocabulary and frequently were taken up in self-documentation and self-reference. Their home-printed, amateur aspect distinguished them from the “prozines” and “semiprozines” which were representative of a more polished and professional part of the science fiction scene. 

Making zines is an example of non-alienated labor, creative and rewarding (Burt 1998). In line with this political attitude, zines were then taken up by a variety of artistic communities beyond science fiction, in particular those focused on music, art, and leftist issues—the format became highly politicized in the midcentury, used to criticize the establishment (Guerra & Quintela 2019). [[Queering|Queer]] punk zines, for example, proliferated in the 80s and 90s and were “part of an ongoing process of producing, within forms of representation, a range of possible identities” amongst their producers and consumers (Fenster 1993).

Serving as a central mode of expression of, and communication amongst, [[underground]] cultures of the latter half of the 20th century, zines “reinforce calls to participation in ways that established artists and theorists can't” (Burt 1998) and their spirit of amateur creativity has been taken up in various forms by digital communities today. Additionally, zines are still actively produced as an art form and literary format, and can be found in many independent bookstores and other urban locations.
