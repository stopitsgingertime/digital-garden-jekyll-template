The amateur in sports occupies a very specific and historically defined position. The concept has remained relevant since the professionalization of sports in the late 19th century and even today is a flashpoint for controversy, as the NCAA’s century-long unchanging definition of the amateur student-athlete has suffered criticism and calls for reform due to its exploitative nature.   

“The true amateur is identified by his or her serious commitment to excellence in the sport as evidenced by hard work and a serious practice regimen,” wrote D. Stanley Eitzen in his overview of amateur sport (1989). Eitzen singles out the difference in perception between sports amateurs and others: “the term ‘professional’ is used pejoratively in sport while the amateur is glorified” due to the idea that a professional’s pursuit derives from avarice or selfishness rather than an idealized type of fitness and honest interest.

Athletic amateurism, like that of [[victorians|scientific amateurism]], exists within an evolving societal context of class and gender.
