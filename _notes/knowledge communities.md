The communities which Stebbins studied in his work on [[leisure|serious leisure]] exemplify the importance of generating, sharing, and circulating knowledge within amateur spaces. The accumulation of information can have an effect on the amateur’s cultural capital and status within a community of [[enthusiasm]]. 

In his landmark work *Convergence Culture* (2004), media studies scholar Henry Jenkins explores and defines a new type of emergent cultural community made possible by digital platforms: the knowledge community, from which new types of power emerge, made possible by active or passive participation. 

Knowledge communities made up of amateurs as mediated by digital technology are no longer the marginal, exceptional spaces that Jenkins examined twenty years ago: they are the norm for many people, a typical of environment which can be navigated with ease. 

The amateur’s compulsion towards a social type of knowledge-gathering is now the daily practice of millions of participants in Discord communities devoted to cataloguing and analyzing the “lore” of franchises and celebrities, in precisely the way that Jenkins explained: “What holds a collective intelligence together is not the possession of knowledge—which is relatively static, but the social process of acquiring knowledge—which is dynamic and participatory, continually testing and reaffirming the group’s social ties.”
