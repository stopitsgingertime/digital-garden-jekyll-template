References to amateurism as a desirable state to be embodied or reclaimed must deal at least briefly with the densely weighted associations of the term and practice with hegemonic examples such as the [[Victorians|“gentlemen scientists”]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the amateur [[sports|sportsmen]] of the Victorian and Edwardian era. 

Women’s participation in these spaces were limited by gendered expectations and restrictions; but that did not mean they did not embody the amateur experience. Mary Anning, to take one outstanding example, was driven by her passion for fossil-collecting to becoming one of the most outstanding and impactful paleontologists of her day. 

Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie, in her survey of 19th and early 20th-century female astronomers, argued that as professionalization increased in certain scientific domains at the end of the 19th century, it had the effect of closing off those arenas entirely to women, forcing them to occupy the category of “obligatory amateur” (2000). Being consigned to amateur status despite professional-level skills and knowledge, women like the astronomer Annie Russell Maunder were still able to achieve prominence in the field, thanks to the ongoing recognition of the importance of amateur astronomical efforts, as well as via advantageous marriages and social connections. 

In addition to understanding the pressures and structures which resulted in obligatory amateurism, the obscuring of female-dominated domestic pursuits requires reclamation of those practices into the overall narrative of the amateur. Creators of [[commonplace book|commonplace books]], for example, were not just hobbyists but active amateurs, pursuing serious [[leisure]] as an integral part of their reception of culture.
