Some amateurs might see themselves as beginners, on the road to accomplishment and professionalization. But many might see themselves as happily ensconced in a community which does not demand advancement nor “proof” of experience and knowledge in order to participate. 

In any case the *consequences* of amateur participation which may result in what could objectively considered “advancement” — e.g. the accumulation of knowledge, the improving of skills, the acquisition of a social network or community — are often not in and of themselves the *goals* of that participation. The goal is merely to explore, experience, pursue, enjoy, etc. 

So the conscious adoption of the amateur attitude can result in the ongoing maintenance of a sort of perpetual-beginner state of total potential, that state which Edward Said considered to be the ideal for professional scholars, developing only “when the conditions of his reality become equal to the generosity of his, of everyman’s, intellectual potential” (1975). 

This is what Kara Wittman identifies as a necessary element of originality, when it comes to professional and academic writing: “something we move steadily away from as experienced scholars and then look for in the receding category of the amateur: the promise of beginning” (2019). 

Being able to retain the mindset of the beginner, with all of its [[enthusiasm]] and openness, can have a major effect on any kind of creative practice.
