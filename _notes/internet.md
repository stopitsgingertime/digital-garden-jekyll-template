A new era of the amateur dawned with the introduction of networked digital communication. Bringing experience from the preexisting deep amateur cultural wells of ham [[radio]] and [[journalism|independent print publishing]], and an enthusiasm for innovation in the use and maintenance of technology, the denizens of the early internet formed the basis for what was to come.  

From [[the WELL]] and other BBSes to Usenet and eventually the Web and independent websites, the broadening of access that occurred due to advances in technology (and increased affordability of said technology) over the 1980s and 1990s was also a broadening of participation. 

This transitional period was characterized by asynchronicity; interest-based communities; direction and invention by committed hobbyists versus commercial interests; and an increasing internationalism as new technologies allowed for greater connectivity between network nodes. The Eternal September in 1994 on Usenet more or less marked the end of the bulletin board era, and very possibly was a premonition of the essential ungovernability of mass platforms (Fidler 2017).

Even as recently as Robert Stebbins’ synthesizing work on serious [[leisure]] literature in the late 2000s, it was not necessarily a given that amateur communities would conduct themselves digitally by default or at all. And as research into platform dynamics have shown, the increasing inextricability of digital culture and commerce has made the conducting of passion online a [[Neoliberal economy|complicated proposition]]. The surfacing of the [[underground]] through digital visibility also has implications for the sustainability of amateur practices. 

But it is clear that the benefits that digital connectivity have brought to the amateur and their interests are the fulfillment of promises made over a hundred years ago, when enthusiasm drove the development of networks of independent practice and collaboration.
