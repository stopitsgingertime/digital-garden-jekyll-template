During the heady days of the Romantic era, poetry [[obsession|obsessives]] kept commonplace books of their favorite stanzas, and copied them into the albums of friends alongside original verses and commentary. For women of the literary class in America and Britain, commonplacing and album-making (otherwise known as scrapbooking) were elements of a participatory reading culture that took place in domestic spaces as well as at a distance through the sharing of books and the transmission of the excerpts within them.

Both men and women participated in participatory album-based traditions of coterie exchange, but as the album became increasingly feminized during the 19th century, many women participated in writing original manuscript poetry for small groups of friends. As Michael C. Cohen notes, “Poetry writing had indeed become democratized, and […] women, children, and others with limited access to literary culture were especially important producers of manuscript verse” (2016). For these groups of amateurs, literary culture became accessible through a combination of the material form of the album and the utilization of existing social networks of similarly interested women.
