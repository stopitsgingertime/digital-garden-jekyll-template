The WELL was an early internet community, founded in 1985 by Steward Brand as a spinoff of his cult-favorite hippie periodical the *Whole Earth Catalog.* 
It ran on a single server in Brand’s Sausalito offices and was accessible, pre-Web, via BBS (Bulletin Board Software) over a modem. When local disc jockey David Gans joined in 1986 he was soon followed by the Dead’s erstwhile lyricist and longtime booster John Perry Barlow (eventually one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation) and it was he who brought with him a wave of Deadheads, who were already connected to each other through in-person and magazine spaces but were always eager to find a new medium through which to express their [[transformative works|fandom.]] 

Thus the WELL became *the* place to go to discuss the Grateful Dead. The Deadheads were so dedicated to their online space that they became the primary driver of revenue for the WELL and pretty much the reason that it could continue to stay online; and they formed an important blueprint for the many, many electronically networked fandoms that would come after them.
