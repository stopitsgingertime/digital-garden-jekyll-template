The flaneur, that passive but perceptive stroller-through of fin-de-siecle Paris streets, is an archetypal amateur of the past, representing a permanently bygone type of urban leisure. Walter Benjamin, introducing the flaneur into academic theory by way of his commentary on Baudelaire’s use of the figure, argued that the flaneur represented a triumphant joy through watching, as opposed to the stagnant gawping of the flaneur’s opposite, the *baudad.*

Though the flaneur, in their dedication to leisured seriousness, represents a certain kind of amateur, the fact that they are depicted as being solitary and apart-from-the-crowd is in contrast with the ideal social circulation of [[enthusiasm|enthusiastic affect]] that modern amateurism represents, in the context of [[knowledge communities]] and internet cultures. 

But a phrase specifically used in relation to the flaneur, by Benjamin in others, is “amateur detective.” The flaneur was a “man of leisure […] who turned his overdeveloped sensibilities to dwell on mysteries and telling details” (Shaya 2004) and it is this active, invested “detective” sensibility that offsets the non-amateurish tendencies of the flaneur to represent a kind of urban detachment.
