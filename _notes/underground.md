Subculture is central to many aspects of amateurism. The serious [[leisure]] conducted by amateurs outside of the realms of professional and domestic responsibilities often takes the form of the participation in some kind of subcultural community, often to be found in the “underground” of culture and mediated by interpersonal hierarchies of taste and status. 

Underground film, music, art, and literature formed the basis for the avant-garde during the 20th century. The complex associations of “underground,” “avant-garde,” and “cool” persisted until they were challenged by the rise of digital networks and the immediate accessibility of information, art, and entertainment through those networks without the imposition of gatekeepers or protective hierarchy. 

Still, culture as produced by underground labor remains vibrant. Independent artistic scenes, especially queer, digital, and/or leftist ones unbounded by geography, represent the promise of contemporary amateurism. Independent games on itch.io, independent music on Bandcamp, and independent transformative literature on Tumblr and Archive of our Own, all provide a counterbalance (if not actual resistance) to dominant hegemonic cultural regimes. 

With regards to underground cultures, Stephen Burt observes that “We can understand what it means to belong to a particular community by knowing what it means to sell out, to betray” (1998). In the context of amateurism this might have once meant turning “professional,” but with the pressures of the economy bearing down on all participants in amateur or leisure cultures, it can instead mean a betrayal of moral, ethical, or political values which are specific to the communities.
