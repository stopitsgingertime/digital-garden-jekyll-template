In 2007, Robert Stebbins could confidently declare that certain fields of serious [[leisure]] had always and would always remain staunchly non-professional. 

However, in the last five years, research on what scholars call the “platformized creative worker” has shown that digital platforms have allowed amateurs to monetize their pastimes not through traditional routes to professionalization but via audience-building and monetization on social media. This might be done by influencers who earn money off of sponsorships and endorsing products to their audiences, or craftspeople or artists who are able to turn their independent creative work into a sustainable business by marketing to potential buyers, or performers who are able to earn money solely through audience relationships.

In her study of amateur fashion bloggers, Brooke Duffy (xx) identifies neoliberal post-Fordist economic pressures as one of the main factors in the increasing population of digital content creators who attempt to make a living or earn additional income from their amateur activities. 

The kind of strict division between work and leisure that the research of sociologists of leisure has been predicated on, beginning in the 1980s, has been degraded by the increasing prominence of the “precariat,” the class of exploited creative workers who are affected by the collapse of the boundaries of work and play, and of community and industry, by exposure to increasing amounts of risk and instability in their careers (Glatt 2022).
