<p>Robert Stebbins, a leading scholar on the study of leisure and leisure participants, developed a three-part lens called “the serious leisure perspective” in order to understand and categorize how people spend their free time.</p>

<p>Serious leisure, he states, “is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer core activity that people find so substantial, interesting, and fulfilling that, in the typical case, they launch themselves on a (leisure) career centered on acquiring and expressing a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience” (2007).</p>

<p>In this way, serious leisure is separate from casual and product-based leisure, neither of which can provide the long-term benefits and positive outcomes which serious leisure can. </p>

<p>Participants in serious leisure necessarily find themselves as part of communities or “social worlds” with practices and mores which have “coalesced into a […] sphere of interest and involvement for participants (Unruh 1980, quoted in Stebbins 2007). </p>

<p>The amateur in this case identifies strongly with their pursuit, in some cases perhaps more so than they do with their paid or professional career. </p>

<p>Stebbins links the intense approach towards serious leisure with “psychological flow,” the concept of an optimal mental state popularized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. This intrinsically rewarding affective experience is central to the continued pursuit of a “career” (as Stebbins frames it) in serious leisure, perhaps in ways that go beyond the sensible and into the [[obsessive|obsession]].</p>
