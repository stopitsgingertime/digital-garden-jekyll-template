# Amateur from A to Z: The Essay

## Introduction
In the context of professionalized cultures of knowledge such as the modern university, the very existence of the passionate amateur can “complicate what it means to be knowledgeable, wield facts, and perform authority” (Majumde & Vaddar 2019). 

The role of the amateur in society has undergone large-scale shifts over the past two centuries. On a very broad level, the trend at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th was one of professionalization, in which communities of knowledge and social worlds have instituted processes and hierarchies designed to designate and centralize authority. Lately, under conditions of technological democratization, these hierarchies have been subject to major shifts, affecting prominent areas of cultural production.

In exploring how the practices and creative strategies engineered by “fan” or “hobbyist” subcultures make their way into the professional mainstream, and how those practices and strategies are afforded and affected by the platforms and communication technologies used to pursue them, I want to put forth the basis of an individual methodology based on the amateur identity. Specifically, I will examine subcultural motivation based on the concepts related to the amateur: social worlds, psychological flow, communications technology, and most importantly the affect of enthusiasm, in order to argue that continually occupying an individual and social position as amateur can have far-reaching and important effects on creative practices, including scholarly research.

Academic literature regarding the amateur is for the most part divided between the approach of the social sciences, which analyzes behavior, reward, and motivation when it comes to amateur practices via sociological and psychological methods; the approach of cultural history, which examines the social networks and technologies of past amateur cultures; and the approach of media and digital studies, which considers the amateur and their place in the contexts of today such as in cultures of practice and affinity, social networking platforms, and other bounded environments. 

There is also a great deal of writing on the amateur-as-concept by those outside the academy, including by cultural critics, essayists, and, yes, amateurs of various stripes themselves. In the spirit of the project these writings will also be considered as necessary perspectives.  

In this kind of provisional overview it is difficult to cover all the bases, but I’ve divided the subjects of my creative project into approximately three non-exclusive categories: communities, technologies, and ideas. Each of the 26 snapshots of the past, present, and future of the amateur falls mainly into one of those categories, though of course they might touch on all three. 

By exploring the amateur through the digital medium of my project website, which will display the 26 artifacts as interconnected in an interactive visual web, I want to provoke thought about the relations between practices and communities which seem far disparate in time and motivation. 

Bringing together ideas from sociology, history, critical theory, and media studies, I will make an argument for the use of enthusiasm as a lens through which to understand the broader idea of the amateur, and for furthering the study of leisure and obsession in the context of contemporary, especially digital, cultures. 

All of this is not to say that professionalism ought ever to be abandoned wholesale. There are clear advantages to the theoretical, analytical, and structural competencies of the professional identity and the rigorous specialization that accompanies it. But an understanding of the amateur’s context can allow for its best properties to be woven into practice both inside and outside of professional environments. 

## The Sociological View

Robert A. Stebbins devoted his academic career to the sociological study of leisure, and specifically the development of a perspective on what he calls “serious leisure.” This perspective divides leisure into three main types: serious leisure, casual leisure, and project-based leisure, and through this framework Stebbins and his colleagues have done a great deal of research into various amateur and hobbyist communities, seeking to understand participants’ motivations, outcomes, and phases of engagement with serious leisure over time.

In contrast with serious leisure, Stebbins argues that casual leisure is purely hedonic, providing practitioners with pleasure and enjoyment, in contrast with the “fulfillment and rewardingness” offered by serious leisure (2020). Stebbins identifies eight “durable benefits” in serious leisure: self-actualization, self-enrichment, self-expression, renewal of self, feelings of accomplishment, enhancement of self-image, social interaction and belongingness, and lasting physical products of the activity. 

Serious leisure’s additional broad offer of deeper self-gratification has its foundation in a basic level of pleasure and enjoyment, enhanced by the more complex affordances of what he describes as a “career,” with stages including dabbling, development, fulfillment, and finally a route to possible professionalization. 
Building on this work, Charles Leadbeater and Paul Miller of the British thinktank Demos coined the term “Pro-Am” in 2004 to describe the disruptive groups of amateurs that they saw making a large impact on the emerging cultural landscape of the 21st century: Pro-Ams are, in their words, “innovative, committed and networked amateurs working to professional standards” who in the course of their participation acquire cultural capital and pass along knowledge acquired to other members of the community. 

As open-source enthusiasts who are well-versed in the contemporary developments of networking and communications technologies to influence community-building and knowledge sharing, Leadbeater and Miller emphasize technology in their study of groups, clubs, and communities. However, their view has its limitations. Their gloss of amateur history is limited to the claim that the “new” Pro-Am movement is “not the gentlemanly amateurs of old [...] [they are] knowledgeable, educated, committed and networked, by new technology.” 

Their view is also not necessarily a cultural or affective one. In discussing their definition of a Pro-Am, they emphasize that what sets a Pro-Am apart from, I suppose, a non-Pro-Am, is that they “[set] a professional standard” with regard to their pastime. But that is naturally a subjective definition and one which might be contested by members of various amateur communities, who from an objective viewpoint seem to align with the Pro-Am ideal, but do not necessarily see or feel themselves to be aspiring towards professionalism in any way. 

## Adult Amateurs of the Past 

The Pro-Am Revolution importantly acknowledges amateurs as a source of innovation within culture, briefly drawing parallels between disruptive 20th-century phenomena like the Homebrew Computer Club and the invention of windsurfing to the network of 18th- and 19th-century inventors and men of science who “pursued scientific questions out of curiosity”—but there is much more in that history that deserves contextualization. 

Before “science” and “scientists” were even words in common parlance, wealthy gentlemen of England occupied themselves with investigations into fields of “natural philosophy” that we would now recognize as scientific, including geology, paleontology, and botany. 19th-century science in Britain was defined by its relation to the ruling class’s standards of what constituted  socially appropriate leisure activities for gentlemen. 

The Royal Society of London, “the institutional embodiment of the amateur tradition” (Berman 1975), resisted professionalization until late in the century. What Berman refers to as the “hegemonic ideal” of scientific societies was embodied also by the many antiquarian societies of Britain, made up of passionate historians who maintained professional careers in other fields while pursuing endless accumulation and study of the past’s artifacts and books; and the Royal Geographical Society, which sponsored expeditions to Africa, Asia, and the polar regions in the name of Empire and science. 

But even exploration was a contested space: “[Royal Geographical Society] leaders viewed their society’s activities as scientific even though some in the Royal Society might dismiss them as craft or even hobby” (Larson 2011). Rivalries between and within different schools of science increasingly deployed “amateur” and associated vocabulary in a derogatory manner.

The other well-known bastion of amateurism in this period was that of sports. Just as in the world of leisured scientific pursuits, 19th-century sports saw the origin of the division between the working-class aficionado who sought to earn a living from their sporting career and those who had no need to; the difference was that this division persisted past its (apparent) extinction in science, and remains the center of a great deal of discussion research continuing well into the 21st century. 

“The true amateur is identified by his or her serious commitment to excellence in the sport as evidenced by hard work and a serious practice regimen,” wrote D. Stanley Eitzen in his overview of amateur sport (1975).  Eitzen singles out the difference in perception between sports amateurs and others: “the term ‘professional’ is used pejoratively in sport while the amateur is glorified” due to the idea that a professional’s pursuit derives from avarice or selfishness rather than an idealized type of fitness and honest interest. 

References to amateurism as a desirable state to be embodied or reclaimed must deal at least briefly with the densely weighted associations of the term and practice with these hegemonic examples. The insights to be gained from studying and spotlighting the history of amateurism certainly have to do with identifying ways in which the “lofty ideal” of the amateur has been put to use in order to exclude, oppress, and deny participation. For example, Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie, in her survey of 19th and early 20th-century female astronomers, argues that as professionalization increased in certain scientific domains at the end of the 19th century, it had the effect of closing off those arenas entirely to women, forcing them to occupy the category of “obligatory amateur” (2000). Being consigned to amateur status despite professional-level skills and knowledge, women like the astronomer Annie Russell Maunder were still able to achieve prominence in the field, thanks to the ongoing recognition of the importance of amateur astronomical efforts, as well as via advantageous marriages and social connections. 
But as my project aims to expand the boundaries of what is traditionally considered the history of the amateur, I want to (re)place a number of lesser-known examples into that history,  contextualizing them in parallel to the exclusionary and dominant strata of exalted amateurs. 

The reclamation of amateur literature, for example, might allow for the situating of the social manuscript cultures of 19th-century Britain and America within the continuum of amateur communities. As the use of personal albums became increasingly feminized during the 19th century, for example, many women participated in writing original manuscript poetry for small groups of friends. As Michael C. Cohen notes, “Poetry writing had indeed become democratized, and […] women, children, and others with limited access to literary culture were especially important producers of manuscript verse” (2016). Readers of Byron who copied his poetry into commonplace books belonging to themselves and their friends had an awareness of participating in a collective practice of reception, and organized their readerly activities in accordance with that awareness (Throsby 2019), engaging in acts of interpretation and transformation that have parallels to similar practices in fan and amateur cultures today. For these groups of amateurs, literary culture became accessible through a combination of the material form of the album and the utilization of existing social networks of similarly interested women. 

## Amateurdom, Youth, and Technology

Amateur communities have historically been early adopters of technology, and in fact whole subsets of amateur cultures continue to revolve around experimentation with new technology for the benefit of a more disconnected professional class. 

Additionally, amateur cultures can allow young people (with the resources to do so, generally middle- or upper-class) to ‘try on’ the mantle of professionalism while remaining unbound by responsibility, financial or otherwise. The combination of youthfulness and technology is a potent one which has resulted in a great deal of subcultural innovation on the part of hobbyists, amateurs, and enthusiasts. 

One powerful example is the late-19th century community of “the Dom,” or amateurdom. The invention and popularization of the affordable home printing press in the late 1870s spawned an active subculture of young enthusiasts who devoted a great deal of time and money to the composition, production, and distribution of personally-printed newspapers. This world of Amateurdom was an “an affective state as well as a textual commons” (Gitelman 2014), a “public youth culture” which was powered by a strong community history as well as the rise of the “teenager” as an identity which fell in between traditional childhood and adulthood and required its own pastimes, and strong, social self-definitions.

Another community of amateurs, radio operators, or hams, were so adventurous in their accomplishments and mastery of the technology during the 20th century that they sometimes played essential roles in military or government projects. In the mid-1950s, the Madey brothers of New Jersey were teenage hams who ended up being responsible for a large proportion of communications between the United States government installations in Antarctica and the rest of the US.Their indulgent (and affluent parents) had permitted them to build a 110-foot tall radio antenna in their backyard in Clark, New Jersey. This meant that they could receive transmissions from around the world, including from the base under construction by Navy Seabees at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. 

The Navy men stationed at the base during Operation Deep Freeze would call the Madeys, whose large backyard antenna was able to pick up their signals, and the Madeys would then patch the Antarcticans into the American phone network so they could speak to their families while only paying the the shorter long-distance charge for calling within the country (Hood 2009). 

Not only did they speak to their families, but they Madeys were able to connect the Seabees on demand to various celebrities of the era, including Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Art Linkletter, and even Betty Crocker, according to an oral history interview with a Seabee: 

> *By the way, we talked to Betty Crocker. We talked to her by ham radio. It started out as sort of a joke, but then a little more serious because Chet said, "Call up Betty Crocker. Let's find out how we're supposed to change a recipe." Well, do you know what they did?  They went up in an airplane at the altitude we were at and found out what the amount of change was and came back and told us. (Belanger 1999)*

The story of the Madeys is exceptional, but it demonstrates not only the possibilities at the heart of the amateur state but an important and defining characteristic. The amateur state is one of openness to possibility: “a readiness to have habits and preconceptions challenged and a willingness to be changed by the experience” (Attridge 2019). There is an investigative process, a searching compulsion towards the finding-out-how, that is characteristic of technological amateur communities. Hampered by slow-moving hierarchies and blindspots of professional bureaucracy, gaps in the governmental and military deployment to Antarctica were left to be filled by fast-moving, committed and innovative youths.

Subcultural artistic spaces which are populated by young people are also necessarily powered by amateur labor and affect, and facilitated by technology. The connection between youth, technology, and the amateur is evidenced by my project’s example of the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), affordable music software which allowed for artists to create hit songs easily with little training. The ability to create and record music almost for free transformed the hierarchy of the industry in the mid-2000s, and allowed the amateur musician or beatmaker to ascend to the top without needing to kowtow to engineers or labels for studio time. Instrumentalist and hitmaker Steve Lacy famously produced hits for Kanye West on his iPhone, on a mobile version of GarageBand, before upgrading to more traditional DAWs and studio equipment (Pierce, 2017). 

The DAW, alongside distribution made possible by noncommercial file-sharing services such as Napster and Kazaa, was also behind popularization of a new kind of transformative practice, the mashup: combinations of songs, “mashed-up” with each other and overlaid into remixes that stand on their own. The mashup genre was popularized and made emblematic of the new 21st century era of the democratization of culture through technology. As John Shiga identified, “A new amateur musicianship emerges from this process, based on the reorganization of the relations that constitute musical recordings” (2007). Taken together with other transformative work types that could be defined or analyzed as mashups, they represent the possibilities inherent in technology’s relationship to art, especially from the perspective of the amateur.

Another example I spotlight in my project is that of the zine. The growth of zine-making practices in the 20th century was afforded by the increasing availability of cheap copying technology. In the 1960s when the Xerox was first flourishing, cultural anxieties about the decreasing importance of the book were present in the popular press. “Authorship and readership alike can become production-oriented under xerography,” Marshall McLuhan wrote in 1966, predicting a revolution in the world of publishing.

Beginning in the interwar period with the science fiction subculture’s distribution and production of fanzines, zines were then taken up by a variety of artistic communities beyond science fiction, in particular those focused on music, art, and leftist issues—the format became highly politicized in the midcentury, used to criticize the establishment (Guerra & Quintela 2019). 

These zines, as material representations of the subcultures they came from, spawned their own idiolectic vocabulary and frequently were taken up in self-documentation and self-reference. They served as an example of non-alienated labor, creative and rewarding (Burt 1998) and offered a central mode of expression of, and communication amongst, underground cultures, such as the queer underground. Queer punk zines proliferated in the 80s and 90s and were “part of an ongoing process of producing, within forms of representation, a range of possible identities” amongst their producers and consumers (Fenster 1993).

An amateur queer historian, Jim Kepner, wrote in ONE Magazine in 1955: “Perhaps the history that will emerge, being largely the work of amateurs, will suffer some of the telltale effects of scholastic shortcomings, yet this will not be the first field to be staked out by autonomous students, and in time, when the foundations have been laid, the professionals may be emboldened to apply the finishing touches” (quoted in Richlin, 2005). Underground by nature for most of the recent past, queer subcultures—just like the other subaltern communities like youth subcultures and women’s domestic practices—for that reason have a deep connection to the concept of the amateur.


## Future Professionalization & the Creator Economy

In 2007, Stebbins could confidently declare that “[s]everal hobbyist fields [...] have shown a tendency over the years to remain essentially non-professional, among them scrap booking, ultimate Frisbee, sport hunting, and mountain trekking.” 

However, in the last five years, research on what scholars call the “platformized creative worker” has shown that digital platforms have allowed amateurs to professionalize their pastimes not through traditional routes to professionalization but via audience-building and monetization on social media. This might be done by influencers who earn money off of sponsorships and endorsing products to their audiences, or craftspeople or artists who are able to turn their independent creative work into a sustainable business by marketing to potential buyers, or performers who are able to earn money solely through audience relationships

Scrapbooking, just to take one of Stebbins’ examples, is a profitable business for many TikTok creators, who document their creative process for an online audience and sell their products as a supplement to a full-time day job or a domestic career. Amateur athletes such as skateboarders and mountain climbers can also easily build audiences on social media and attract the attention of sponsors, turning any sport, no matter how obscure, into a potential money-maker, as long as the athlete has people watching.  

Ethnographic research by Zoe Glatt into the creator communities of Los Angeles and London has shown the difficulties faced by this class of creators. The field that “began in 2005 as pockets of amateur creators on YouTube has grown into a mature infrastructure of diverse and competing platforms, such as Instagram, TikTok, Patreon, Facebook, and Twitch” (Glatt 2022) has since ballooned into a massive industry. Democratization of media technology and platforms allowed creators to begin earning money off of content as additional income and eventually as their main source of income. This has led to the professionalization, to some extent, of the “creator” class, but it could also be said that the existence of the 

The kind of strict division between work and leisure that the research of sociologists of leisure has been predicated on, beginning in the 1980s, has been degraded by the increasing prominence of the “precariat,” the class of exploited creative workers who are affected by the collapse of the boundaries of work and play, and of community and industry, by exposure to increasing amounts of risk and instability in their careers (Glatt 2022). 

Stebbins argues that “serious leisure is not estimated to be widespread” and that the majority of leisure undertaken by people is of the casual subtype (2002). But by making possible and popularizing deceptively easy-looking routes to monetization, digital technology and platformization of leisure has allowed for an entry into fulfilling and community-based serious leisure, which disrupts some of the traditional boundaries between a “serious leisure career” and a traditional professional career. 

These economic changes have had a marked effect on subcultures. Stephen Burt observes that “We can understand what it means to belong to a particular community by knowing what it means to sell out, to betray” (1998). In the context of amateurism this might have once meant turning “professional,” but with the pressures of the economy bearing down on all participants in amateur or leisure cultures, it can instead mean a betrayal of moral, ethical, or political values which are specific to the communities. 

## Conclusion: Enthusiasm as Methodology

Robert Stebbins links the intense approach towards serious leisure with “psychological flow,” the concept of an optimal mental state popularized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. This intrinsically rewarding affective experience is central to the continued pursuit of a “career” (as Stebbins frames it) in serious leisure, perhaps in ways that go beyond the sensible and into the obsessive. 

He also argues that because the “central life interest” that serious leisure becomes to many of its practitioners “can only emerge from positive emotional states, obsessive and compulsive activities can never become central life interests.” However, I would disagree with this, especially in light of how digital technology can make personal enthusiasm contingent with involvement in large virtual communities. These environments, affected by commercially-oriented platform affordances, can contribute to transmuting positive enthusiastic states into compulsive engagement in harmful activities like morally motivated networked harassment (see Marwick, 2022). 
Stebbins also describes how serious leisure activities are necessarily complex, requiring a great deal of skill and mastery, or else they would not be considered “serious” with the possibility for long-term careers within them. This seems to elide the possibility for serious leisure in what I would identify as the enthusiastic cultural communities of reception—in another word, fandoms. 

The participants in a digital community like BookTok, for example, are incredibly “serious” about a type of leisure which a perspective like that of Stebbins might identify as casual: reading romance novels, discussing them, and recommending them to other enthusiasts. 

The inherent passivity of “passive entertainment” has been questioned as far back as the 1980s by scholars like Henry Jenkins, who helped to found the subfield of fan studies when he refuted the concept of the “couch potato” television fan in his landmark book Textual Poachers. In his view, many viewers who might have been categorized as passive were in fact actively “poaching” storylines, taking the raw material of TV and actively reworking it in a frequently communal and social environment: an environment of passionate discourse and intense imagination. 
If, as Stebbins claims, “most casual leisure [is] too fleeting, mundane, and commonplace to become the basis for a distinctive identity for most people” then how to account for the intense identification that readers, watchers, and “passive” gamers have with their activities and the communities in which they partake in those activities? Those who are “singular nexus[es] in the network of cultural processes and products” with “idiocultural” (Attridge 2019) and highly unique experiences of reception which still yet have the potential to be shared and amplified? Leadbeater and Miller, with their slightly more expansive view of the “Pro-Am” concept, note that Pro-Ams “regard consumption as a productive activity” and acknowledge practices of knowledge sharing and network building even amongst these consumer-amateurs. 

Networks of communication form and are formed by networks of enthusiasm. This trend is highly visible in the development of the early internet: fan groups and media discussion formed a vital element of Usenet and early BBSes. On the WELL, the 1980s internet forum founded by counter-culture icon Steward Brand, fans of the Grateful Dead innovated and iterated on practices of analog community such as tape-trading and obsessive cataloging. 
Henry Jenkins acknowledged the phenomenon of digital knowledge communities in his book Convergence Culture. The practices he observed resonate with those observed by Leadbeater and Miller in their Pro-Am studies, in which “[pro-ams] enjoy immersion in a body of knowledge held by a community [...] they also like passing it on, being part of a flow of knowledge through a community.”

The amateur’s compulsion towards a social type of knowledge-gathering is now the daily practice of millions of participants in Discord communities devoted to cataloguing and analyzing the “lore” of franchises and celebrities, in precisely the way that Jenkins explained: “What holds a collective intelligence together is not the possession of knowledge—which is relatively static, but the social process of acquiring knowledge—which is dynamic and participatory, continually testing and reaffirming the group’s social ties” (2004). 

Even as Stebbins’ carefully delineated constellation of sociological concepts has been useful for me when considering the different taxonomies of the amateur throughout recent history that I’ve examined, I have found limitations in the Serious Leisure Perspective’s consideration of emotion and especially social emotion. Generally it is a study of individual motivation and reward with regards to free time activities; useful data, testimony, and analysis which somehow still feels incomplete. 

Perhaps it is because I feel an absence of the psychological dimension of the amateur, at least in the sense of how it relates to my own experiences. Claiming based upon research conducted that “the drive to find fulfillment in serious leisure is the drive to experience the rewards of a given leisure activity, such that its costs are seen by the participant as more or less insignificant by comparison” (2020), Stebbins’ perspective elides the more abstract, often mystical pull that a given amateur occupation may exert—which is to say, the shading of enthusiasm into obsession, and vice versa. 

Historically speaking, even as the idea of the amateur became complicated in scientific communities of the late Victorian period, the independent enthusiastic state which the most committed amateurs entered could be and indeed was productive of a great deal of accomplishment, though sometimes at the cost of normative behavior. Many of the most lauded minds of the era demonstrated enthusiasm verging on (and often crossing over into) insanity. 
In his study of the history of obsession, Lennard J. Davis concisely acknowledges that “obsessive behaviors that could lead to madness could at the same time lead to science” (2017) and observes that even Freud, an iconic obsessive himself, made observations about the libidinal pleasures of thinking too much. The immersive and enjoyable state of obsession is deeply connected to the history of the amateur.

How might we distinguish between the state of being compelled emotionally towards a hobby or pursuit, and the secondary “higher” state of being captivated or captured by it, ensconced fully within an encompassing and potentially overwhelming amateurism? Conjoining literary theory and its explication of emotion to the sociological perspective can be useful here. In Roland Barthes’ last essay he describes the enrapturement of obsession, and its difficulty in finding verbal expression, as resembling the experience of a young child: “it is the still-shapeless space of fantasy, of the imagination, of creation” (1980). With Barthes’ observation of Stendhal’s infatuation with Italy as ludic, a connection can be drawn between Huizinga’s theories of play, and the techniques of embodiment which play teaches, consciously or unconsciously, and the enthrallment of the amateur. 
Enthusiasm takes on the form of a bodily sensation, a tugging-on from behind the navel, often embarrassing, frequently overpowering, produced by a relation to a desired object, difficult to express in language—aphasic, as Barthes would have it. “Stendhal syndrome,” a pop-culture concept referring to nervous breakdown or other psychosomatic symptoms in response to the witnessing of powerful art, may relate to the physiological and emotional extremes that an enthusiastic amateur is driven to by their internal experience, as mediated through the externalities of their pursuits. 

In contrast with Barthes’ citation of repetition as the producer of a sort of Sisyphean dissatisfaction, the amateur’s engagement with repetition as a source of pleasure is explained by Umberto Eco as again something which restores a childlike affinity, the “infantile need of hearing again always the same story” (1985) which the post-post-modern sensibility of contemporary media aesthetics works to satisfy, such as serialization, franchising, genre-ization, and the deployment of familiar tropes. 

The amateur “mode” is one that is accessible and achievable through a set of personal affective states: wonder, “flow,” play, obsession, and of course enthusiasm. Writing on the phenomena of the undergraduate as amateur, Kara Wittman argues that “[when] we ask our undergraduates to be original we ask them to practice being professionals, but we also look for something of the wonder and self-creation that amateurs seem to represent” (2019). 
In many situations and schema it is obvious that professionalism is preferred and probably required. But, at the same time, the neoliberal capitalistic state of platform culture’s pervasive encouragement towards professionalization of one’s hobbies and passions necessitates antidotes. Identifying the places in society where an amateur approach can benefit and combine with existing practices and produce new possibilities. 

To take just one example: the leisured pace that amateur activities can unfold at can allow for new avenues into empiricism which the pressures of professionalized environments prevent. In the context of research and the academy, Carolyn Dinshaw in her study of enthusiastic medievalists and queer temporality specifically identifies amateur researchers as “a bit queer in a professionalized, detached modernist world” and observes that “the act of taking one’s own sweet time asserts a queer force [..] Queer, amateur: these are mutually reinforcing terms” (2012). And in the larger context of culture, Ben Walters aligns amateurism with both anarchism and queerness, arguing that it “can be a potent mode for disrupting normative expectations” (2020). 
Importantly, the disruptiveness which inheres within amateur practices is that which challenges expectations, not outcomes: what I wish to put on display in my project is how amateur practices and communities can and do have real material impacts which could not be accomplished solely through traditional, expected, or professional avenues. 

It is possible that many may require teaching or in fact re-teaching on how to be an amateur, in the form of an orienting-towards, a systematic but playful discovery of the elements of the mindset and body-set of passionate enthusiasm. This is the positionality Barthes was striving towards when he discussed his potential and perhaps never-to-be-realized novel-writing project; and the positionality which I myself aspire to in various areas of my research. 

With regards to my ABCs of amateurism, I am hoping that the disparate nodes in the map can serve if possible as a sort of tutorial, an immersive glimpse within the past and future of the amateur.
