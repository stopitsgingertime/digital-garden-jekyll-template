# Amateur from A to Z

## Introduction/Abstract

In the context of professionalized cultures of knowledge such as the modern university, the very existence of the passionate amateur can “complicate what it means to be knowledgeable, wield facts, and perform authority” (Majumde & Vaddar 2019). 

The role of the amateur in society has undergone large-scale shifts over the past two centuries. On a very broad level, the trend at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th was one of professionalization, in which communities of knowledge and social worlds have instituted processes and hierarchies designed to designate and centralize authority. Lately, under conditions of technological democratization, these hierarchies have been subject to major shifts, affecting prominent areas of cultural production.

In exploring how the practices and creative strategies engineered by “fan” or “hobbyist” subcultures make their way into the professional mainstream, and how those practices and strategies are afforded and affected by the platforms and communication technologies used to pursue them, I want to put forth the basis of a critical lens based on the amateur identity. Specifically, I will examine subcultural motivation based on the concepts related to the amateur: social worlds, psychological flow, communications technology, and most importantly the affect of enthusiasm, in order to argue that continually occupying an individual and social position as amateur can have far-reaching and important effects on creative practices, including scholarly research.

Academic literature regarding the amateur is for the most part divided between the approach of the social sciences, which analyzes behavior, reward, and motivation when it comes to amateur practices via sociological and psychological methods; the approach of cultural history, which examines the social networks and technologies of past amateur cultures; and the approach of media and digital studies, which considers the amateur and their place in the contexts of today such as in artistic subcultures, social networking platforms, and other bounded environments. 

There is also a great deal of writing on the amateur-as-concept by those outside the academy, including by cultural critics, essayists, and, yes, amateurs of various stripes themselves. In the spirit of the project these writings will also be considered as necessary perspectives.  

In this kind of provisional overview it is difficult to cover all the bases, but I’ve divided the subjects of my creative project into approximately three non-exclusive categories: communities, technologies, and ideas. Each of the 26 snapshots of the past, present, and future of the amateur falls mainly into one of those categories, though of course they might touch on all three. 

By exploring the amateur through the digital medium of my project website, which will display the 26 artifacts as interconnected in an interactive visual web, I want to provoke thought about the relations between practices and communities which seem far disparate in time and motivation. 

Bringing together ideas from sociology, history, critical theory, and media studies, I will make an argument for the use of enthusiasm as a lens through which to understand the broader idea of the amateur, and for furthering the study of leisure and obsession in the context of contemporary, especially digital, cultures. 

All of this is not to say that professionalism ought ever to be abandoned wholesale. There are clear advantages to the theoretical, analytical, and structural competencies of the professional identity and the rigorous specialization that accompanies it. But an understanding of the amateur’s context can allow for its best properties to be woven into practice both inside and outside of professional environments. 


## The Sociological View

Robert A. Stebbins devoted his academic career to the sociological study of leisure, and specifically the development of a perspective on what he calls “serious leisure.” This perspective divides leisure into three main types: serious leisure, casual leisure, and project-based leisure, and through this framework Stebbins and his colleagues have done a great deal of research into various amateur and hobbyist communities, seeking to understand participants’ motivations, outcomes, and phases of engagement with serious leisure over time.
In contrast with serious leisure, Stebbins argues that casual leisure is purely hedonic, providing practitioners with pleasure and enjoyment, in contrast with the “fulfillment and rewardingness” offered by serious leisure (2020). 

Stebbins identifies eight “durable benefits” in serious leisure: self-actualization, self-enrichment, self-expression, renewal of self, feelings of accomplishment, enhancement of self-image, social interaction and belongingness, and lasting physical products of the activity. 

Serious leisure’s additional broad offer of deeper self-gratification has its foundation in a basic level of pleasure and enjoyment, enhanced by the more complex affordances of what he describes as a “career,” with stages including dabbling, development, fulfillment, and finally a route to possible professionalization. 

Building on this work, Charles Leadbeater and Paul Miller of the British thinktank Demos coined the term “Pro-Am” in 2004 to describe the disruptive groups of amateurs that they saw making a large impact on the emerging cultural landscape of the 21st century: Pro-Ams are, in their words, “innovative, committed and networked amateurs working to professional standards” who in the course of their participation acquire cultural capital and pass along knowledge acquired to other members of the community. 

As open-source enthusiasts who are well-versed in the contemporary developments of networking and communications technologies to influence community-building and knowledge sharing, Leadbeater and Miller emphasize technology in their study of groups, clubs, and communities. However, their historical view has its limitations and failures. They claim that the “new” Pro-Am movement is “not the gentlemanly amateurs of old [...] [they are] knowledgeable, educated, committed and networked, by new technology.” 

Their view is also not necessarily a cultural or affective one. In discussing their definition of a Pro-Am, they emphasize that what sets a Pro-Am apart from, I suppose, a non-Pro-Am, is that they “[set] a professional standard” with regard to their pastime. But that is naturally a subjective definition and one which might be contested by members of various amateur communities, who from an objective viewpoint seem to align with the Pro-Am ideal, but do not necessarily see or feel themselves to be aspiring towards professionalism in any way.
